# Analysing_Arctic_Ice_maps


The purpose of this project is to observe the change in Antarctic using on image data, plotting it, and combining it in various ways for analysis. 
The data used in this problem set is collected by two different satellite missions.
All the data were already downloaded and transformed to an easy-to-use format from [here](https://seaice.uni-bremen.de/start/data-archive/). 
Firstly, I fetched the image data from the source. Then Calculated the variations in ice concentrations per unit area over the time.
Then plotted it using different matplotlib.pyplot fucntions to properly visualize the changes and differences.
